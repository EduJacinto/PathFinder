# Path Finder in Grid World
This project implements various search algorithms for a pathfinding agent in a two-dimensional, grid world.
The search algorithms are: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Best-First Search, and A*.

## Requirements
- Python3.11 or better
- matplotlib
- common libraries

## Project Structure
- **grid.py**
    Contains class for point object and definitions for visualizing the grid world.
- **search.py**
    Implements the main module that initiates the user interface and calls all necessary functions for 
    program execution. 
- **SearchandExpand.py**
    Contains definitions for all the search algorithms and helper functions.
- **utils.py**
    Contains class definitions for the data structures used by the search algorithms.
